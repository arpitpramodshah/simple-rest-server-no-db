                    <p>A quality secret door is a very precise machine that must maintain extremely tight tolerances. Many companies simply attach a hinge to a piece of carpentry, resulting in a secret door that sags, warps, rubs, and looks obvious, especially when a load is applied, or with time as humidity and temperature fluctuate.</p>

                    <p>Creative Home Engineering products are precisely engineered to handle these conditions while maintaining those essential tight tolerances. They contain hidden cavities with steel structural support members to keep the door strong and rigid, along with our patented custom hinges, and numerous other technical innovations that have set us apart as the leader in the secret door industry.</p>

                    <p>Our secret passageways are designed to be installed in minutes anywhere in the world. They come pre-hung in their own door frames which simply slide into the rough door opening as though it were a typical appliance. If you can install a conventional pre-hung door, you can install one of our secret passageways.</p>

Some of us have just got to have a pool, while others want clever modern design, sustainability, or integration with natural elements. No matter what it is that makes your dream home unique, here are a few examples of homes where people have been able to realize some of their greatest home design fantasies."</p>
                    <p>"These ingenious home improvements run from pools and aquariums to cleverly-hidden storage spaces, multi-purpose furniture and… cat transit walkways. Maybe you’ll recognize something that you’ve always wanted to see, or maybe the pictures will get your juices flowing and inspire you to come up with or even build something new."</p>
